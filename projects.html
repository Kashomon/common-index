        <strong>Machine Learning Presentation: 13 Jan 2010</strong> 
        <p> For the 
        <a href="http://www.meetup.com/frontier-developers/">Frontier Developers' Meetup</a>,
        I gave an introductory presentation on Machine Learning.  These
        slides cover the basics of Perceptrons and give (very short)
        introductions to Neural Networks, SVMs, and Unsupervised Learning.
        They conclude with several slides devoted to a discussion of
        application.  For the slides, check out: 
        <a href="files/MLBeamerPresent.pdf">here.</a>

        <strong>Machine Vision: Go Board Recognition </strong> 
        <p>
        Currently (Summer 2010), I am using machine vision techniques to
        identify Go boards from raw camera images for use in the 
        <a href="http://www.gokgs.com">KGS</a>
        Android application to help record Go games.  This project is still
        underway, but I am having some good success so far.  Eventually, I plan
        on having an entire page for this project, because there were many
        interesting problems that had to be tackled along the way.  Also, the
        code will eventually be posted here when it gets more finalized.
        </p>
        <p>
        I used Java exclusively and programmed all the machine vision methods
        from scratch.  If you are interested in the basics of machine vision
        and image processing,
        <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/hipr_top.htm"> HIPR2 </a> 
        is a fantastic resource.

        <strong> Machine Learning: Support Vector Machine Research</strong>
        <p>
        In the Spring of 2010, I researched the effects that noise has on
        Support Vector Machines.  The idea for this project came from
        researching Fuzzy Support Vector Machines, about which you can find
        more in my
        <a href="files/FSVMPresentation.pdf">introductory presentation</a>
        on the subject.  FSVMs do not seem to have great improvements over
        normal SVMs -- but why?  My hypothesis was that SVMs are naturally
        fairly resistent to outliers, and so it is rather difficult to achieve
        better results with FSVMs.  I tested this hypothesis by looking
        specifically at the resiliance of SVMs (trained with a variety of
        different kernels) to noise -- data points with flipped class labels.
        My results supported this hypothesis, which you can check out in my 
        <a href="files/AML_Project.pdf">original paper</a>
        or in the
        <a href="files/ResultsPresentation.pdf">results-presentation</a>
        I gave for the Machine Learning seminar led by  
        <a href="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~mm/">Melanie Mitchell</a> 
        at Portland State University.
        </p>
        <p>
        For those interested in the technologies, I used 
        <a href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/">LIBSVM</a>
        to train and test Support Vector Machines, I used R to create the
        artificial data, I used Python for general scipting, and I used
        Matplotlib to make the graphs.  Eventually I plan on posting the python
        code online, but it needs some revision before it is public-worthy

        <strong> Modern Cryptography </strong> <br>
        <p>
        In the Winter/Spring of 2010, I participated in the Cryptography
        Reading Group at Portland State University and led by 
        <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~teshrim/">Tom Shrimpton</a>
        in which I gave presentations on
        <a href="files/CryptoPresentation.pdf">Lossy Trapdoor Functions</a>,
        developed by 
        <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~cpeikert/">Chris Peikert</a>,
        and on "Practical Chosen Ciphertext Secure Encryption from Factoring,"
        a paper by 
        <a href="http://www.iks.kit.edu/index.php?id=hofheinz">Dennis Hofheinz</a>
        and

        Cryptography lies in a fascinating place between pure mathematics and
        computer science, and moreover has profound practical applications. I
        was introduced to cryptography in Tom Shrimpton's introductory course
        in the Fall/Winter of 2009.  For those just getting into cryptography,
        the best resource out there for modern cryptography is the set of 
        <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/cse207/classnotes.html">class notes</a>
        written by the giants of cryptography Mihir Bellare and Phillip
        Rogaway.

        <strong> Complexity Theory and Mathematical Games: Undergraduate Thesis
        </strong>
        <p> I completed an undergraduate thesis at Reed College in complexity
        theory, called 
        <em><a href="files/thesis.pdf">Mathematical Games</a></em>, 
        based upon the work of
        <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rah/">Bob Hearn</a> 
        in the Spring of 2009 with my advisor
        <a href="http://people.reed.edu/~jamie/">Jamie Pommersheim</a>.  
        I begin my thesis by looking at the theory behind the hardness classes
        <strong>P</strong>, <strong>NP</strong>, <strong>PSPACE</strong>, and
        <strong>EXPTIME</strong>, and show how they are used in Bob Hearn's
        Constraint Logic, a general model for games.  I then apply Constraint
        Logic to several games, one of which 
        (<a href="http://fizzlebot.com/gridgame.php">Grid</a>)
        was (to my knowledge) unexplored in the literature before this thesis.

        <strong> Javascript Explorations </strong>
        <p>
        I have been fascinated by the idea of creating a Go Program that can
        assist me in studying Go Problems, and perhaps studying in general.
        Those, of course, are a long way off, but the intermediate steps have
        been fun. Here is one project: 
        <a href="DisplayExperiment.html">DisplayExperiment</a>.

        <br> 

        <p> Here is another (more go related): 
        <a href="GoDisplay.html">GoDisplay</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        The inspiration for these projects comes from my recent discovery of
        the awesome libraries
        <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> 
        and 
        <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a>,
        for manipulating the DOM and creating SVG respectively.  These are
        standard libraries for a reason, and if you haven't, you ought to check
        them out.  Also, for those interested in Javascript's advanced
        features, I highly recommend Spencer Tipping's 
        <a href="https://github.com/spencertipping/js-in-ten-minutes">Js in Ten Minutes</a>

        <strong> Go Diagram and Layout Generation </strong>
        <p> In the summer of 2009, I typeset two books of Go problems from
        various sources (mostly books in Japanese). The first is a book of 
        <a href="files/IntermediateTesuji.pdf">Tesuji</a>, 
        and the second is a book of
        <a href="files/IntermedTsumego.pdf">Life and Death</a>.
        I used a slightly modified version of Dan Bump's 
        <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~reid/Games-Go-Sgf2Dg-4.211/sgf2dg">sgf2dg</a>
        to create Encapsulated Postscript output from SGF files.  Then, I used
        Python (and eps2pdf) to transform EPS files into PDF and to generate
        reasonable-looking LaTeX code.
