  <strong>Go Publishing</strong><br>
  <em>September 2010 - Present</em>
  <p>
  I have been working off and on to develop some open source software written in
  Java to create Go digital go books (as PDFs).  I won't say to much more about
  this, but it's coming along quite well.  I expect a release by the end of the
  summer 2011.

  <strong>Go Studying Program</strong><br>
  <em>December 2010 - Present</em>
  <p>
  I am working on a website that combines a Javascript client-side program +
  some sort of backend that will function as a Go-study website similar to
  GoProblems.com and the Emerald Chess server.  Some initial work on the
  client-side code has completed, using what I've learned from my JavaScript
  explorations.

   <strong>Machine Learning Presentation</strong><br>
   <em>13 January 2011</em> 
  <p> For the 
  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/frontier-developers/">Frontier Developers' Meetup</a>,
  I gave an introductory presentation on Machine Learning.  These
  slides cover the basics of Perceptrons and give (very short)
  introductions to Neural Networks, SVMs, and Unsupervised Learning.
  They conclude with several slides devoted to a discussion of
  application.  For the slides, check out:

  <strong>Machine Vision: Go Board Recognition </strong><br>
  <em>Summer 2010</em>
  <p>
  I used machine vision techniques to identify Go boards from raw camera
  images.  This project is still underway, but I am having some good
  success so far.  Eventually, I plan on having an entire page for this
  project, because there were many interesting problems that had to be
  tackled along the way.  Also, the code will eventually be posted here
  when it gets more finalized.
  </p>
  <p>
  I used Java exclusively and programmed all the machine vision methods
  from scratch.  If you are interested in the basics of machine vision
  and image processing,
  <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/hipr_top.htm"> HIPR2 </a> 
  is a fantastic resource.

  <strong> Machine Learning: Support Vector Machine Research</strong><br>
  <em>Spring 2011</em>
  <p>
  I researched the effects that noise has on Support Vector Machines.  The idea
  for this project came from researching Fuzzy Support Vector Machines, about
  which you can find more in my
  <a href="files/FSVMPresentation.pdf">introductory presentation</a>
  on the subject.  FSVMs do not seem to have great improvements over
  normal SVMs -- but why?  My hypothesis was that SVMs are naturally
  fairly resistent to outliers, and so it is rather difficult to achieve
  better results with FSVMs.  I tested this hypothesis by looking
  specifically at the resiliance of SVMs (trained with a variety of
  different kernels) to noise -- data points with flipped class labels.
  My results supported this hypothesis, which you can check out in my 
  <a href="files/AML_Project.pdf">original paper</a>
  or in the
  <a href="files/ResultsPresentation.pdf">results-presentation</a>
  I gave for the Machine Learning seminar led by  
  <a href="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~mm/">Melanie Mitchell</a> 
  at Portland State University.
  </p>
  <p>
  For those interested in the technologies, I used 
  <a href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/">LIBSVM</a>
  to train and test Support Vector Machines, I used R to create the
  artificial data, I used Python for general scipting, and I used
  Matplotlib to make the graphs.  Eventually I plan on posting the python
  code online, but it needs some revision before it is public-worthy

  <strong> Modern Cryptography </strong> <br>
  <em> Winter 2010 </em>
  <p>
  In the Winter/Spring of 2010, I participated in the Cryptography
  Reading Group at Portland State University and led by 
  <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~teshrim/">Tom Shrimpton</a>
  in which I gave presentations on
  <a href="files/CryptoPresentation.pdf">Lossy Trapdoor Functions</a>,
  developed by 
  <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~cpeikert/">Chris Peikert</a>,
  and on "Practical Chosen Ciphertext Secure Encryption from Factoring,"
  a paper by 
  <a href="http://www.iks.kit.edu/index.php?id=hofheinz">Dennis Hofheinz</a>
  and 
  <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~kiltz/research.html">Eike Kiltz</a>.
  </p>
  <p> 
  Cryptography lies in a fascinating place between pure mathematics and
  computer science, and moreover has profound practical applications. I
  was introduced to cryptography in Tom Shrimpton's introductory course
  in the Fall/Winter of 2009.  For those just getting into cryptography,
  the best resource out there for modern cryptography is the set of 
  <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/cse207/classnotes.html">class notes</a>
  written by the giants of cryptography Mihir Bellare and Phillip
  Rogaway.

  <strong> Javascript Explorations </strong><br>
  <em>December 2010 - February 2011</em>
  <p>
  I have been fascinated by the idea of creating a Go Program that can
  assist me in studying Go Problems, and perhaps studying in general.
  Those, of course, are a long way off, but the intermediate steps have
  been fun. Here is one project: 
  <a href="DisplayExperiment.html">DisplayExperiment</a>.

  <br> 

  <p> Here is another (more go related): 
  <a href="GoDisplay.html">GoDisplay</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The inspiration for these projects comes from my recent discovery of
  the awesome libraries
  <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> 
  and 
  <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a>,
  for manipulating the DOM and creating SVG respectively.  These are
  standard libraries for a reason, and if you haven't, you ought to check
  them out.  Also, for those interested in Javascript's advanced
  features, I highly recommend Spencer Tipping's 
  <a href="https://github.com/spencertipping/js-in-ten-minutes">Js in Ten Minutes</a>

  <strong> Complexity Theory and Mathematical Games: Undergraduate Thesis
  </strong><br>
  <em>September 2009 - May 2010 </em>
  <p> I completed an undergraduate thesis at Reed College in complexity
  theory, called 
  <em><a href="files/thesis.pdf">Mathematical Games</a></em>, 
  based upon the work of
  <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rah/">Bob Hearn</a> 
  in the Spring of 2009 with my advisor
  <a href="http://people.reed.edu/~jamie/">Jamie Pommersheim</a>.  
  I begin my thesis by looking at the theory behind the hardness classes
  <strong>P</strong>, <strong>NP</strong>, <strong>PSPACE</strong>, and
  <strong>EXPTIME</strong>, and show how they are used in Bob Hearn's
  Constraint Logic, a general model for games.  I then apply Constraint
  Logic to several games, one of which 
  (<a href="http://fizzlebot.com/gridgame.php">Grid</a>)
  was (to my knowledge) unexplored in the literature before this thesis.

  <strong> Go Diagram and Layout Generation </strong><br>
  <em> Summer 2009 </em>
  <p> I typeset two books of Go problems from
  various sources (mostly books in Japanese). The first is a book of 
  <a href="files/IntermediateTesuji.pdf">Tesuji</a>, 
  and the second is a book of
  <a href="files/IntermedTsumego.pdf">Life and Death</a>.
  I used a slightly modified version of Dan Bump's 
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~reid/Games-Go-Sgf2Dg-4.211/sgf2dg">sgf2dg</a>
  to create Encapsulated Postscript output from SGF files.  Then, I used
  Python (and eps2pdf) to transform EPS files into PDF and to generate
  reasonable-looking LaTeX code.
