        <strong> Education: </strong>
        I graduated from <a href="http://www.reed.edu">Reed College</a> in
        the Spring of 2009 with a degree in Mathematics.  For the following
        year, I took courses in computer science at Portland State University.

        <strong> Academic Interests: </strong>
        I am interested in machine learning, machine vision, cryptography,
        algorithms, and complexity/computability theory. Also, I will always
        hold a deep love for mathematics and especially modern algebra.

      <p> "Paul Erd&ouml;s liked to talk about The Book, in which God maintains the perfect proofs for mathematical theorems, following the dictum of G. H. Hardy that there is no permanent place for ugly mathematics.  Erd&ouml;s also said that you need not believe in God, but as a mathematician, you should believe in The Book."    --Preface to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KvQr9l0wgf8C&lpg=PP1&dq=proofs%20from%20the%20book&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false"><em> Proofs from the Book </em></a>
