title: More Pyrite
date: 11 December 2011
---
<p> 
Pyrite is progressing well.  I just added
<a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/">Mako templating</a> 
into the mix, and fixed several old bugs.  I think I have also finally figured
out the weird problems with Python imports
</p>

<p> 
Working on this project has been interesting.  There are dozens of static blog
generators out there already, so I sometimes feel silly reinventing the wheel.
And then again, there are vast improvements to be made in this area.  For
example, most (including this one at the moment) are not designed for
consumption by the general public.  Most just produce HTML instead of harnessing
the power of Javascript.
</p>

<p> 
I am quite satisfied to have a working product.  Now it's time to refine the beast.

title: Pyrite Enters Dogfood
date: 3 December 2011

<p> 
So begins a blog for my website;
<a href="https://github.com/Kashomon/pyrite">Pyrite</a> 
is entering alpha, and with this blog, I am beginning to dogfood my creation.
Pyrite is a blog-generator in the style of 
<a href="http://www.blogofile.com/">Blogofile</a>, 
but with a significantly different philosophy.  I believe that existing
websites should have a way to integrate a blog using Javascript in a seamless
way, and hence, I created Pyrite. </p>

<p>
I realize that this blog has very few features of a traditional blog.  There
are no internal-links available yet (like a date-archive), there are no feed
options, and there isn't yet the ability to create comments.  However, these
are all features I'm  working on.  I feel proud to have created this, and I'm
excited to see where this project will go.
