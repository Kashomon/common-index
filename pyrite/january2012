Title: Vim Projects!
Date: 10 January 2012

<p> Hello!  I've had a busy month since my last post.

<p> First, I finished two Vim projects.  The first is a 
<a href="http://www.github.com/Kashomon/vimporter">
Java-Importer plugin </a> that automaticall creates a Java Import and puts it
in sorted order.  This was quite an extensive project and took learning a bunch
of Vim hackery, but the finished project is quite wonderful.  You can specify
any of Jars, Projects-paths, or Javadoc directories. Moreover, the plugin
gives you a slick interface for choosing your favorite import to load.  I also
wrote a version of this to work with the build environment at work.

<p> Second, I finished <a href="http://www.github.com/Kashomon/vild"> Vild,
</a> which is a general Vim-build tool, allowing project-specific definitions
and commands.  If you're using Vim for multiple projects in multiple languages,
I highly recommend this tool; it has certainly made my Vim experience far
more enjoyable.

<p> I plan on working again on Pyrite again soon, but I'm also working on Otre
again as well.
