I just added\n<a href=\"http://www.makotemplates.org/\">Mako templating</a> \ninto the mix, and fixed several old bugs.  I think I have also finally figured\nout the weird problems with Python imports\n</p>\n\n<p> \nWorking on this project has been interesting.  There are dozens of static blog\ngenerators out there already, so I sometimes feel silly reinventing the wheel.\nAnd then again, there are vast improvements to be made in this area.  For\nexample, most (including this one at the moment) are not designed for\nconsumption by the general public.  Most just produce HTML instead of harnessing\nthe power of Javascript.\n</p>\n\n<p> \nI am quite satisfied to have a working product.  Now it's time to refine the beast.\n</p></div>\n\n</li>\n",

I believe that existing\nwebsites should have a way to integrate a blog using Javascript in a seamless\nway, and hence, I created Pyrite. </p>\n\n<p>\nI realize that this blog has very few features of a traditional blog.  There\nare no internal-links available yet (like a date-archive), there are no feed\noptions, and there isn't yet the ability to create comments.  However, these\nare all features I'm  working on.  I feel proud to have created this, and I'm\nexcited to see where this project will go.\n</p></div>\n\n</li>\n"
