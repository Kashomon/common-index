  <strong> <a href="http://momentdev.wordpress.com">Moments and Deviations </a> </strong> 
  is a blog devoted to fun and interesting problems in Computer Science
  and Mathematics for the purpose of keeping me continually learning new
  ideas and practicing existing skills.  If you have interesting problems,
  feel free to send those to me and I shall post them (with perhaps a
  solution). 
  </p>

  <p>
  Currently, the blog is stalled while I spend my free time working
  on my go projects, but I hope to start it up again at some point.

  <strong> <a href="http://hametegroup.blogspot.com">The Hamete Go Group</a> </strong>
  is a blog devoted to studying the game go.  I created this blog so I
  could still be a part of the awesome Portland Go community despite
  having moved away.

  I really like having a Go blog, but after spending some time
  programming and also exploring existing client-side Go programs, I think
  <a href="http://eidogo.com/">EidoGo</a>
  would be more ideal than 
  <a href="http://www.gludion.com/go/">GoSWF</a>,
  which is what I used for the Hamete Go Group @ Blogspot.
  Unfortunately, this would require me to host the blog on my website, which
  will take a bit of work.  Like Moments and Deviations, I am planning on
  picking this project up again when I get some more time.
