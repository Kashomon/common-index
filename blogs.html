        is a blog devoted to fun and interesting problems in Computer Science
        and Mathematics for the purpose of keeping me continually learning new
        ideas and practicing existing skills.  If you have interesting problems,
        feel free to send those to me and I shall post them (with perhaps a
        solution). Currently, the plan is to post an update about once a week
        (probably on the weekend).

        <strong> <a href="http://hametegroup.blogspot.com">The Hamete Go Group</a> </strong>
        is a blog devoted to studying the game Go.  I created this blog so I
        could still be a part of the awesome Portland Go community despite
        having moved away.  This blog is new so I cannot predict the direction
        in which this blog will eventually proceed, but so far I am quite
        excited.  If this is something you are interested in beyond just
        reading (i.e., posting Go games), send me an email and I will give you
        author-privileges on the blog.

      <p> "Paul Erd&ouml;s liked to talk about The Book, in which God maintains the perfect proofs for mathematical theorems, following the dictum of G. H. Hardy that there is no permanent place for ugly mathematics.  Erd&ouml;s also said that you need not believe in God, but as a mathematician, you should believe in The Book."    --Preface to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KvQr9l0wgf8C&lpg=PP1&dq=proofs%20from%20the%20book&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false"><em> Proofs from the Book </em></a>
