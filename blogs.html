  is a blog devoted to fun and interesting problems in Computer Science
  and Mathematics for the purpose of keeping me continually learning new
  ideas and practicing existing skills.  If you have interesting problems,
  feel free to send those to me and I shall post them (with perhaps a
  solution). Currently, the plan is to post an update about once a week
  (probably on the weekend).

  <strong> <a href="http://hametegroup.blogspot.com">The Hamete Go Group</a> </strong>
  is a blog devoted to studying the game Go.  I created this blog so I
  could still be a part of the awesome Portland Go community despite
  having moved away.  This blog is new so I cannot predict the direction
  in which this blog will eventually proceed, but so far I am quite
  excited.  If this is something you are interested in beyond just
  reading (i.e., posting Go games), send me an email and I will give you
  author-privileges on the blog.
